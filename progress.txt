Task: Create /figures page with search bar and figures grid
Status: done
Learnings:
- FiguresPage follows ChatsListPage pattern - container layout with padding for mobile bottom nav
- useSubscription returns subscription object, pro status derived from status === "pro" check
- Search filtering uses case-insensitive includes: toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
- Skeleton loading matches grid layout (2/3/4 cols) with 8 placeholders for consistent UX
- Routes inside AppLayout+PreferencesWrapper get full app chrome (sidebar, preferences dialog)
- Biome auto-formats on commit, typecheck runs via pre-commit hook

Task: Redesign HomePage with centered prompt, figure dropdown, 2x2 grid, and view more link
Status: done
Learnings:
- PromptInput components (PromptInput, PromptInputHeader, PromptInputBody, PromptInputFooter, PromptInputTextarea, PromptInputSubmit) from @christianai/ui
- Select components + Avatar from @christianai/ui work well for dropdown with avatars
- useCreateConversation returns mutation with mutateAsync(figureId), navigate with state.initialMessage
- subscription.data.status === "active" for pro check (not "pro")
- Card component from @christianai/ui for figure cards with hover effects
- Pre-commit hook runs biome + typecheck automatically

Task: Review all changes, test flows, and ensure consistency
Status: done
Learnings:
- Frontend-engineer agents effective for comprehensive UI/UX reviews with specific line-by-line analysis
- Subscription status checks must be consistent across all pages - easy to introduce drift
- Avatar fallbacks critical for missing data - apply pattern consistently across all avatar displays
- TypeScript compilation passing doesn't guarantee runtime consistency - semantic review needed
- Git diff review + specialized agent reviews catch issues human reviewers might miss
- All homepage flows verified: prompt box, dropdown, grid, navigation, card selection
- /figures page verified: search, grid layout, locked figures, toast errors, navigation
- Tests passing (37/37), typecheck clean, pre-commit hooks passed
