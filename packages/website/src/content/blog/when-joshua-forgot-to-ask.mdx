We've all been there. A new opportunity lands on your desk, a relationship seems to be blossoming perfectly, or a major purchase looks like an absolute steal. The evidence is right in front of you. It looks good, it feels right, and your logic says "go."

But in the rush of excitement, there’s one step we often skip: asking the One who sees the end from the beginning.

The story of Joshua and the Gibeonites in **Joshua 9** offers a profound lesson for every believer navigating the complexities of modern life. It’s a story about the danger of relying on human wisdom and the incredible hope found in God’s redeeming grace when we fail to seek His counsel.

## The Deception: When Things Aren't What They Seem

After the miraculous victories at Jericho and Ai, Joshua was a leader at the height of his influence. The surrounding nations were terrified. But while others prepared for war, the people of Gibeon chose a different path: deception.

They showed up at the Israelite camp with worn-out sacks, cracked wineskins, and moldy bread. They claimed to be from a "very distant country," seeking a peace treaty. They had the "proof" right there—their bread was dry and moldy, and their clothes were tattered from the "long journey."

Joshua and the leaders of Israel looked at the evidence. They tasted the bread. They listened to the story. Everything seemed to add up.

## The Critical Verse

Then comes one of the most sobering verses in the Old Testament:

> *"The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD."* (**Joshua 9:14**)

They relied on their senses. They relied on their experience. They relied on their logic. But they forgot to ask God.

## Why We Forget to Seek Counsel

Why did a leader as experienced as Joshua miss this? His reasons are often our reasons today:

1.  **Past Success**: When things are going well, we start to trust our own "winning streak" rather than the God who gave us the victory.
2.  **Compelling Evidence**: The "moldy bread" of our lives—the data, the appearances, the testimonials—can be so convincing that we feel we don't *need* to pray about it.
3.  **The Need for Speed**: We often feel pressured to make quick decisions, fearing that if we pause to pray, the opportunity will vanish.

## The Hope in the Mistake

The Israelites eventually discovered the truth—the Gibeonites were actually their neighbors. Because they had sworn an oath in the name of the LORD, they were bound to a treaty they never should have made.

But here is where the story turns hopeful. Even though Joshua made a mistake, God didn't abandon him. In the very next chapter, when the Gibeonites were attacked, God used that "mistake" to give Israel a massive victory over five kings, even making the sun stand still to complete the task.

**Our God is a specialist at redeeming our missteps when we turn back to Him in humility.**

## Seeking Divine Counsel in the Digital Age

How do we practically seek God's counsel today? 

*   **Prioritize Prayer**: Make it a rule—no major decision without a "pause for prayer."
*   **Scripture as a Compass**: Does the decision align with biblical truth?
*   **Wise Counsel**: Surround yourself with believers who can offer objective, spiritual perspectives.
*   **Spiritual Discernment**: Ask the Holy Spirit for the "eyes to see" past the moldy bread.

## Practical Steps for Your Next Big Decision

1.  **Wait 24 Hours**: If it’s a major commitment, give yourself a day to pray.
2.  **Identify the "Moldy Bread"**: What part of this decision are you making based *only* on appearances?
3.  **Ask the Hard Question**: "Lord, is there something I'm not seeing?"
4.  **Check for Peace**: God's guidance often comes with a "peace that transcends understanding," even if the logic is still unfolding.

## A Prayer for Guidance

*Heavenly Father, thank You that You never leave us to navigate life alone. Forgive us for the times we’ve rushed ahead without asking for Your heart. Give us the humility of Joshua to learn from our mistakes and the courage to wait for Your voice. Lead us in Your truth today. In Jesus’ name, Amen.*
